### Copying a File:

To copy files, we use the `cp` command. This creates a duplicate of the file in the new location and leaves the old one in place:

### Renaming a File:

To Rename a file in linux you have to use the command `mv` It is mainly used to move files, but you can use it f or renaming by use it `mv theoldname.txt thenewname.txt` for example:

it was `newfile` but after renaming it to `newfile2` it changed.

### Removing a File:

For removing a File we use the command `rm`+the file name, for example:
