# Linux-Basics-For-Hackers
# Before starting we have to define some important things like :

**Directory**: This is the same as a folder in Windows. A directory provides a way of
organizing files, usually in a hierarchical manner.

**Home**: Each user has their own /home directory, and this is generally where files you
create will be saved by default.

**Kali Linux**: is a distribution of Linux specifically designed for penetration testing.
It has hundreds of tools preinstalled, saving you the hours it would take to download
and install them yourself.

**root**: Like nearly every operating system, Linux has an administrator or superuser
account, designed for use by a trusted person who can do nearly anything on the
system. This would include such things as reconfiguring the system, adding users, and
changing passwords. In Linux, that account is called root. As a hacker or pentester, you
will often use the root account to give yourself control over the system. In fact, many
hacker tools require that you use the root account.

**Terminal**: This is a command line interface (CLI), Yes, it's the green that hackers use in movies  ðŸ’» ðŸ’».

**/root**: The home directory of the all powerful root user.

**/etc**: Generally contains the Linux configuration filesâ€”files that control when and how
programs start up

**/home**: The userâ€™s home directory

**/mnt**: Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the filesystem

# After this wonderful introductory trip, we will explain some important commands like:
 **pwd** : To see your current location in system files.
 
 
 **whoami** : To know the user which you entered with.

**cd** : for changing directories:
**_cd + the file name._**

If you want to take a step back use : "**cd ..**" and two steps use "**cd .. ..**" and so on.

**ls**: for listing a Dir.

use **ls -l** to know more things about the files like history, owner and size.

and use **ls -la** to see the hidden files.

**--help / -h / -?** : for getting help: **_tool name + -h : nmap -h._**

or _**--help + tool name.**_

_**We will finish here and continue later...**_
